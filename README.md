# Optimizing Commute Happiness

A data-driven project exploring how **weather**, **road quality**, **green cover**, and **traffic** influence daily commute comfort and mode of transport choices. The goal is to identify smart patterns and generate actionable recommendations to promote happier, healthier, and more efficient commutes.

---

## Objectives

- Understand the influence of external factors on commute preferences.
- Analyze patterns between transport modes and environmental conditions.
- Build smart travel suggestions based on real-time conditions.
- Promote green, health-conscious commuting habits.

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Collection**: Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Maps API, OpenWeather API, Google Earth Engine
- **Data Storage & Management**: Excel, CSV, (Optional) MySQL
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy), Excel
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI, Tableau
- **Automation & Integration**: Python scripts (for real-time API data pulls and automation)
- **Dashboards & Reporting**: Power BI, Tableau, Excel (Pivot Charts)
- **Machine Learning (Basic)**: Scikit-learn (for correlation analysis, classification of mode preferences, or clustering if implemented)
- **Version Control & Documentation**: Git, GitHub

## Methodology

1. Design a schema for structured commute data in Google Sheets.
2. Collect live commute, weather, and environmental data using APIs.
3. Receive user feedback via Google Forms.
4. Clean and preprocess data using Python and Excel.
5. Analyze relationships between commute factors and choices.
6. Visualize findings using interactive dashboards (Power BI/Tableau).
7. Generate insights and smart mode suggestions.

# Optimizing Commute Happiness

A data-driven project exploring how **weather**, **road quality**, **green cover**, and **traffic** influence daily commute comfort and mode of transport choices. The goal is to identify smart patterns and generate actionable recommendations to promote happier, healthier, and more efficient commutes.

## Objectives

- Understand the influence of external factors on commute preferences.
- Analyze patterns between transport modes and environmental conditions.
- Build smart travel suggestions based on real-time conditions.
- Promote green, health-conscious commuting habits.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Data Collection**: Google Forms, Google Sheets, Python (APIs)
- **Data Cleaning**: Excel, Python (Pandas)
- **Visualization**: Power BI / Tableau
- **Automation**: Python scripts
- **(Optional)**: MySQL for structured data storage
